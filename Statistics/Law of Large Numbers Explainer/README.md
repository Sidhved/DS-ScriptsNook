**PROJECT TITLE**

Law of Large Numbers


**GOAL**

The goal of this script is to educate the users about the Statistical concept of **Law of Large Numbers**.


**PURPOSE**

Statistics is a vast field a+nd applies to our day-to-day life. Thus knowing such things is extremely beneficial. 


**DESCRIPTION**

- This script explains the fundamentals of Law of Large Numbers using an interactive example by taking some user inputs and displaying beautiful Cyberpunk themed plots.
- The libraries used are as follows:
	1. numpy
	2. pandas
	3. matplotlib
	4. seaborn
	5. streamlit
	6. mplcyberpunk
	

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

I had created this script in an intuitive way to let the user try and understand the cocnept by using different examples of their own choice.


**WORKFLOW OF YOUR PROJECT FILES**

- User is required to put some inputs wherever prompted, and based on the inputs user can create plots.
- The script is developed using Streamlit, thus on running the script, a web-based UI is started. 
- The page has informative material with static text and few interactive objects which can be displayed based on the user inputs.
- By the end of this script, the user 


**USAGE**

As stated above, Statistics is a vast domain and one must have knowledge of such basic concepts before start building career in Data Science.


**USE CASES**

One can try the different use cases on the script giving different manual data inputs and check the output plots.


**LIBRARIES USED**
All the libraries used in this script are as follows:
	1. numpy
	2. pandas
	3. matplotlib
	4. seaborn
	5. streamlit
	6. mplcyberpunk


**SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

- Change the Working Directory to the folder where this LoLN.py file is present.
- Install the dependencies available in requirements.txt using the command **pip install -r requirements.txt** in your shell.


**RESEARCH**

The topic was well researched before framing it as a Python Program. Author had referred various internet blogs and video incluing MIT Statistics Docs, Machine Learning Mastery Blogs etc.
