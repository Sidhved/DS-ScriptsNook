**Homer Vs Bart Classification**

**GOAL**

To create a Convolutional Neural Network Model to classify Homer and Bart images (Simpson Characters).

**PURPOSE**

To utilise the power of Convolutional Neural Network for image classification

**DATASET** (if applicable)

Dataset is included as zip file. Please extract the zip file.

**WORKFLOW OF YOUR PROJECT FILES**

Refer the comments in notebook file for explanations

**USAGE**

I have choosed this issue specifically to prove the power of Convolutional Networks for image datasets.

**USE CASES**

All types of Image Processings.

**LIBRARIES USED**

- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- keras
- cv2
- sklearn

**Folder Contents**
- Images - Contain Model architecture and training graph
- Model and Weight - Contains saved weights and model object as JSON file
- homer_bart_2.zip - dataset as zip file (extract before running notebook)

**ADVANTAGES**

For image processing CNN takes lesser time and space occupied by the weights are lesser compared to ANN

**CONCLUSION**

CNN is the best for image processing.
