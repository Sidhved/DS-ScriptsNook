PROJECT TITLE

Introduction to Matplotlib

GOAL

In this tutorial, I have mentioned the details related to matplotlib library such as how to install it, what are its features and how to implement it in any project. 

PURPOSE

I have choosen this topic to make an elaborate tutorial on Matplotlib which  includes all the important information related to it. This is one of the most useful library in Python which helps in making many projects in Machine learning and Data Science. This helps in giving information in form of various graphs. As it is evident that pictorial reference of any thing has more impact on the user, therefore this library is very useful. 

DESCRIPTION

I have described how to install Matplotlib library, then how it is used, what are the fuctions related to it. This will help the user to understand it's working and implement this in their own work.


LIBRARIES USED

1. matplotlib
2. numpy

ADVANTAGES

1. Simple and easy to use.
2. It provides high quality pictures and graphs.

DISADVANTAGES

1.The library is very low- level.
2. Matplotlib is getting slower as the script progresses.

APPLICATIONS

This librabry is used in many Machine Learning and Data Science projects such as:
1) project involving visual data
2) project to depict different sets of information
3) usable as MATLAB 

CONCLUSION

I have tried to include all the points related to Matplotlib library. Hope this helps and clear all your doubts.
